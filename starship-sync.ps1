# ============================================================================
#  starship-sync.ps1  -  refresh starship/starship.toml from dotfiles-core
#
#  dotfiles-Windows is a STANDALONE repo (no core/ subtree). starship is the rare
#  Core asset the host CAN share verbatim: starship.toml is cross-shell by design,
#  and Core now carries `powershell_indicator` in [shell] so the single canonical
#  file renders under both zsh and PowerShell. This is the small, deliberate sync
#  that keeps starship/starship.toml in lockstep with Core — the sibling of
#  nvim-sync.ps1 (whose pattern this mirrors exactly).
#
#  Usage (from the repo root):
#    .\starship-sync.ps1                                  # shallow-clone the remote, copy the toml
#    .\starship-sync.ps1 -CoreLocal C:\src\dotfiles-core  # copy from an existing clone instead
#    .\starship-sync.ps1 -Branch dev                      # sync from a different Core branch
#    .\starship-sync.ps1 -Ref v2.1.0                       # pin an exact Core commit/tag (reproducible)
#    .\starship-sync.ps1 -Force                           # abandon a recorded pin, track the branch tip
#
#  PINS ARE STICKY. Once a run records `pinned = vX.Y.Z` in starship/.core-ref, a
#  later bare run honours it rather than silently dragging the file to the branch
#  tip — the scheduled workflow invokes this script with no arguments, so without
#  that a deliberate pin would be reverted with nothing in the diff to say so.
#  Use -Force to deliberately drop the pin and resume tracking -Branch.
#
#  After it runs: review `git diff starship/`, then commit.

# commit IS a release, 'v2.0.0-3-gabc1234' a few commits past one. Empty (and the
# `tag` line then omitted) when nothing matches: Core carries no release tag yet, the
# clone is still shallow past the nearest one, or -CoreLocal isn't a git repo at all.
#
# --match 'v[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*' IS LOAD-BEARING, not tidiness (#202; ports the same
# fix from dotfiles-core#515 / sync-core.sh). Every Core release ALSO carries a moving
# major alias (`v4`), re-pointed on each cut by Core's scripts/tag-release.sh with
# `git tag -fa`, AFTER the specific tag. Both are annotated and both sit on the release
# commit, so `git describe` breaks the tie by TAGGER TIME and prefers the alias. That
# is how nvim/.core-ref came to record `tag = v4-19-g10ad221`: a provenance field
# naming a target that moves out from under it, so the same recorded string means a
# DIFFERENT commit after the next release. The two-dot shape excludes the alias by
# construction. (It also immunizes a -CoreLocal run against a locally STALE alias —
# a plain `git fetch` never force-updates an existing tag.)
#
# Don't "simplify" by dropping --tags: that restricts describe to annotated tags, and
# the alias is annotated too, so it would fix nothing.
#
# When ONLY an alias exists, describe finds nothing and the caller omits the line — an
# ABSENT tag is strictly better than a wrong one, and `commit` (the full SHA the parity
# gate and dotfiles-doctor actually read) stays the source of truth either way.
#
# The single-quoted glob reaches git VERBATIM: PowerShell does not expand wildcards in
# native-command arguments (that is a POSIX shell behaviour); the quotes only stop its
# own parser from reading `[`, `]` and `*`.
#
# try/catch, not `2>$null` alone: today $PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference is
# $false, so a failing git yields $null instead of throwing under this script's
# ErrorActionPreference='Stop'. If a future pwsh flips that default, the redirect on its
# own would stop protecting the contract and a tag-less Core would abort the whole sync.
# The contract is "best-effort, never fatal" — state it rather than inherit it.
