# ============================================================================
#  maint/Maintenance.ps1  -  the daily "update everything (that's safe)" runner.
# ============================================================================
#  Windows port of Core's maint/dotfiles-maint.sh. Invoked by Task Scheduler
#  (install it with `maint-install` from os/40-maint.ps1). Designed to run
#  UNATTENDED and NON-INTERACTIVE: every step is guarded and a failure of one
#  step never aborts the rest.
#
#  What it touches automatically (all USER-SPACE, low-risk):
#    • scoop:   update buckets, upgrade apps, cleanup
#    • scoop:   re-create the junctions scoop just remade, admin-trusted, so an
#               ssh session can traverse them. No-op unless the run is elevated —
#               it logs one SKIPPED line. See docs/REMOTE-ACCESS.md.
#    • mise:    plugin update + upgrade   (if installed)
#    • neovim:  Lazy! sync / TSUpdate / MasonUpdate  (headless, timeout-guarded)
#    • PowerShell modules: PSReadLine / Terminal-Icons / PSFzf / CompletionPredictor
#
#  winget is OPT-IN: `winget upgrade --all` can launch MSI installers that prompt
#  or restart apps, which isn't safe to run blind. Enable it deliberately:
#    $env:MAINT_WINGET_UPGRADE = '1'   (set in the scheduled task or before a run)
#
#  Env knobs:
#    MAINT_ENABLED          1     # 0 = no-op
#    MAINT_WINGET_UPGRADE   0     # 1 = also `winget upgrade --all` (see above)
#    MAINT_NVIM_TIMEOUT     600   # seconds

    # Two ways a step can fail, and both have to be caught or the log lies:
    #
    #   • it THROWS — a cmdlet with -ErrorAction Stop, or Invoke-WithTimeout's
    #     timeout. Always caught.
    #   • it EXITS NON-ZERO — a native command. PowerShell does not throw for these,
    #     so every one of them used to be logged `ok`. Observed live: `navi repo
    #     update` printed "Shim: Could not create process" and was recorded as ok.
    #
    # $LASTEXITCODE is nulled first because it is SESSION state, not step state: a
    # body made only of cmdlets leaves the PREVIOUS step's value in place, and
    # checking that would blame this step for the last one's exit code. Null after
    # the body means no native command ran, which is not a failure.
    #
    # Known limit: a body chaining several native commands (`scoop cleanup *; scoop
    # cache rm *`) only reports the LAST one's code. Fixing that means splitting the
    # step, not making this cleverer.

    # --- run a process with a timeout (for the headless nvim session) ---------
    # Uses ProcessStartInfo rather than Start-Process, and the reason is the bug that
    # made this whole step a no-op for its entire life.
    #
    # `Start-Process -ArgumentList @(...)` JOINS the array with spaces and does not
    # quote the elements. So
    #     @('--headless', '+Lazy! sync', '+silent! TSUpdateSync', ..., '+qa!')
    # reached nvim as
    #     --headless +Lazy! sync +silent! TSUpdateSync +silent! MasonUpdate +qa!
    # and nvim read `sync`, `TSUpdateSync` and `MasonUpdate` as FILENAMES to open
    # rather than as parts of the preceding +commands. It opened three empty buffers,
    # hit +qa!, and exited 0 in 0.2s having synced nothing. Measured side by side on
    # a real host: Start-Process 0.2s / 0 lines, ProcessStartInfo 5.9s / 398 lines.
    # ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList quotes each element individually, which is the
    # whole difference.
    #
    # Reading the pipes directly also retires the old temp-file dance
    # ("$Log.nvim.out"/".err"), which had its own failure: the output was appended
    # with Add-Content while Step's `*>> $Log` held the same file open, so Windows
    # refused it ("being used by another process") and — non-terminating — the step
    # still said ok. Output is EMITTED here instead, and Step's existing redirect
    # captures it with one handle on the log rather than two.
    #
    # Both pipes are read concurrently on purpose: a child that fills one while the
    # parent blocks on the other deadlocks, and headless nvim writes plenty to both.
    #
    # $LASTEXITCODE is set from the child, so Step's exit-code check can see it —
    # neither Start-Process -PassThru nor [Process]::Start sets it.

    # --- scoop: re-create app junctions so ssh sessions can traverse them ------
    # Under ProcessRedirectionTrustPolicy (Redirection Guard) an ssh/service-lineage
    # process refuses to follow a junction that was CREATED by a non-admin — and scoop
    # creates every `scoop\apps\<app>\current` junction as you, so all scoop tools
    # (starship, mise, psmux, jj…) are unreachable over ssh. Trust is stamped at
    # creation time from the creator's token; ownership is irrelevant (icacls does
    # NOTHING), so the only fix is to re-create the junction from an elevated process.
    # scoop remakes it (untrusted) on every upgrade, so re-do it here, after the
    # upgrade. Needs elevation — re-creating as a non-admin would just re-stamp it
    # untrusted — so the script reports ONCE when unelevated. See docs/REMOTE-ACCESS.md.
    #
    # `apps\<app>\current` is not the only junction scoop makes: it also wires
    # persisted state back out of the app dir into `scoop\persist\<app>\...`, and
    # `scoop\modules\gsudoModule` sits outside apps\ entirely. Those are untrusted
    # for exactly the same reason, so Repair-ScoopJunctions.ps1 walks every
    # directory reparse point under the scoop root rather than just the app dirs.
    #
    # The work lives in that script, not inline here, because the daily task runs
    # UNELEVATED (scoop must never be upgraded as admin) — so the elevated
    # dotfiles-maint-scoop-junctions task needs the same logic as an entry point.

    # Scheduler ACLs its registration to SYSTEM + BUILTIN\Administrators only — the
    # user this run executes as has no read entry at all. So an unelevated
    # Get-ScheduledTask returns nothing whether the task is broken, missing, or
    # perfectly fine, and a check built on that reports a confident FAIL every single
    # day. A run that reliably prints a false error is worse than one that says
    # nothing. That check lives in `maint-status` and `dotfiles-doctor`, which can

    # There used to be a `navi repo update` step here. It never worked on any host:
    # `navi repo` takes only add / browse / help, so the command exited 2 with
    # "unrecognized subcommand 'update'" every single run. Nobody noticed because
    # Step did not check exit codes and logged it ok — the same blind spot that hid
    # the nvim step doing nothing.
    #
    # Removed rather than re-pointed at a working command, because there is no
    # equivalent: navi has no "refresh my repos" verb, and updating imported
    # cheatsheets means git-pulling each one under `navi info cheats-path` by hand.
    # Add that back the day cheat repos are actually imported (`navi repo add`);
    # until then a step that greps for a directory which does not exist is worth
    # less than the line it occupies.

    # --- PowerShell modules ---------------------------------------------------
    # Refresh into the LOCAL (non-OneDrive) modules dir with Save-Module -Force —
    # the same path profile.ps1 prepends and Install-Packages.ps1 seeds. Keeps
    # modules off OneDrive (fast shell start) and sidesteps the old PSReadLine
    # special case: Save-Module just writes the latest Name\Version with no
    # Update-Module-vs-shipped-module friction.
    # Only saved when the gallery actually has something NEWER. Save-Module -Force
    # rewrites <Path>\<Name>\<Version> wholesale even when that exact version is
    # already there, and for a module whose assemblies are mapped into a running
    # PowerShell that overwrite cannot succeed — the files are locked and it fails
    # with "Access to the path ... is denied". PSReadLine is loaded by EVERY session,
    # so on any box with a shell open it failed every single run while being
    # perfectly up to date. Measured here: all four managed modules already matched
    # the gallery, so this step re-downloaded four modules a day to achieve nothing
    # and failed on one of them.
    #
    # A genuinely new version lands in its OWN version directory and never touches
    # the locked one, so the update path that matters is unaffected.
    #
    # Find-Module failing (offline, gallery down) falls THROUGH to Save-Module rather
    # than skipping: an unknown latest version must not read as "up to date", or the
    # step would go quiet on exactly the days it cannot check.
