# Remote access: ssh into this host, and into the distros behind it

Standing OpenSSH Server up on a Windows box that also hosts WSL2 breaks two things
that have nothing obvious to do with sshd:

1. **The PowerShell profile stops loading over ssh** — reported as "untrusted
   source". It still loads fine in Windows Terminal.
2. **The Linux boxes stop answering** — and the ones that do only answer while a
   terminal happens to be open on the host.

Both are real. Neither is a WSL fault, and — importantly — neither is an
execution-policy or Mark-of-the-Web problem, which is where almost every guide
sends you first.

---

## 1. Why the profile is "untrusted" over ssh

**It is Redirection Guard, and it is not configurable.**

Windows enforces the process mitigation `ProcessRedirectionTrustPolicy`
(a.k.a. Redirection Guard) across the whole **service / session-0 lineage**. A
process with it enforced refuses to traverse a reparse point — a symlink or a
junction — whose target sits under a directory owned by a non-admin principal.
The failure is `ERROR_UNTRUSTED_MOUNT_POINT`, which surfaces as:

```
The path cannot be traversed because it contains an untrusted mount point.
```

Every config this repo wires used to be a symlink into a repo under
`C:\Users\<you>\...`, which is exactly the shape the mitigation blocks.

### Confirm it in one command

Run this **in the session that is broken** (over ssh, or from any
scheduled-task/service-launched shell):

```powershell
Add-Type -TypeDefinition @'
using System; using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
public static class M {
  [DllImport("kernel32.dll")] public static extern bool GetProcessMitigationPolicy(IntPtr h,int p,out uint b,IntPtr s);
  [DllImport("kernel32.dll")] public static extern IntPtr GetCurrentProcess();
}
'@
$v = 0
[M]::GetProcessMitigationPolicy([M]::GetCurrentProcess(), 15, [ref]$v, [IntPtr]4) | Out-Null
'0x{0:X}' -f $v      # bit 0 set (e.g. 0x105) = ENFORCED;  0x100 = not enforced
```

Measured on a real host, the split is clean and explains the symptom exactly:

| Process | Policy | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `explorer`, `WindowsTerminal`, `glazewm` | `0x100` | not enforced — this is why the desktop always worked |
| `services.exe`, `wslservice`, Task Scheduler `svchost`, `sshd` | `0x105` | **enforced** — every ssh session inherits this |

### What does *not* fix it

These were each tried on a real host and each did nothing. Do not spend an
evening on them:

| Attempt | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2L:1` | no effect. This is a different mechanism (remote/UNC paths), not Redirection Guard |
| Deleting `MitigationOptions` from the `sshd.exe` IFEO key | no effect — the lineage default still applies |
| Setting IFEO `MitigationOptions` to `REDIRECTION_TRUST_ALWAYS_OFF` (`0x2 << 20`) | **ignored** — the policy is inherited and non-relaxable, which is the entire point of it |
| Changing the **symlink's** owner to `BUILTIN\Administrators` | no effect — ownership is not the discriminator |
| Changing the junction **target's** owner via `icacls /setowner` | no effect either — ownership of neither the link nor its target is checked |
| Running sshd as a real Windows service instead of a scheduled task | would not help **for this**: `services.exe` is `0x105` too. It is still the right way to run sshd, for a different reason — see [Keeping sshd up](#keeping-sshd-up) |

The real discriminator is **who created the reparse point**, not who owns it. NTFS
stamps a trust level onto every junction/symlink at creation time from the creator's
token: a link made by an administrator/SYSTEM is *trusted* and traverses under
enforcement, one made by a standard user is *untrusted* and is refused. Ownership is
irrelevant — which is why `icacls` in any form does nothing. The only lever is to
**re-create the link from an elevated process**. That is a lever for scoop (below),
not for a repo you need to be able to edit as yourself.

### What this repo does instead

Stop using reparse points for the configs that have to work over ssh. The four
that matter are wired as **real files** that pull in the repo copy through the
config format's own include mechanism — same single source of truth, no reparse
point. This is `Kind = 'Stub'` in `Get-DotfilesLinkPlan`
(`powershell/core/05-lib.ps1`), rendered by `Get-DotfilesStubContent`:

| Config | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| `$PROFILE` | a real `.ps1` that dot-sources `powershell/profile.ps1` |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim\init.lua` | a real `init.lua` that prepends `<repo>/nvim` to `runtimepath` and `dofile()`s it |
| `~/.gitconfig` | `[include] path = <repo>/git/.gitconfig` |
| `~/.ssh/config` | `Include <repo>\ssh\config`, on the first line |
| `~/.config/psmux/psmux.conf` | `source-file <repo>\psmux\psmux.conf` — psmux's syntax is tmux-compatible |
| `~/.config/psmux/psmux.reset.conf` | same; this is what the repo conf's own `source-file` line then resolves to |

### When there is no include directive at all

Two more shapes have no include mechanism to reach for, and each gets its own answer
rather than being written off.

**A directory of scripts** — `~/.config/psmux/scripts`, eight pwsh popup helpers.
`Kind = 'StubDir'`: a real directory of one-line **forwarders**, one per script, each
`& '<repo>\psmux\scripts\<name>.ps1' @args`. psmux.conf's eight `display-popup` binds
are untouched — they still name `~/.config/psmux/scripts`, which is simply real now.
`&` rather than dot-sourcing keeps `$PSScriptRoot` on the repo copy.

The cost is that a forwarder directory does **not** track the repo by itself, and
drift runs both ways: a script added upstream has no forwarder, and one deleted
upstream leaves a forwarder pointing at nothing. `Test-StubDirIntoRepo` fails on both,
so install repairs it and `dotfiles-doctor` reports it. Checking only the first
direction is a trap — the stale forwarder is not *missing*, so install says "already
wired" and its own sweep never runs.

**TOML** — `jj` and `mise`. TOML has no include directive, so there is nothing to
stub, and a symlink is unreadable. Both tools take a path from the environment
instead, so `Get-DotfilesEnvPlan` sets these as persistent **User**-scope variables
and neither config is wired as a file at all:

| Variable | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `JJ_CONFIG` | a TOML file or a directory of them; when set it *replaces* the default user-config location (`jj help -k config`) |
| `MISE_GLOBAL_CONFIG_FILE` | mise's global config path |

Measured on this host before the change: `jj config get ui.default-command` answered
*"Value not found"*, and `mise config ls` outside a project listed nothing — both were
silently running on defaults, not erroring.

User scope, because that is what reaches every process: an ssh session gets the user's
environment from the registry, as does a scheduled task. Same mechanism `DOTFILES_WIN`
already relies on. The catch is that a shell **already open** when `install.ps1` ran
keeps the old environment block, so `dotfiles-doctor` checks the process value as well
as the registry and says *"set for new sessions, but missing from THIS one"* rather
than grading it `ok`.

The honest cost of the env-var approach: nothing exists at
`~/.config/mise/config.toml` any more, so the wiring is invisible at the conventional
path. That is exactly why those rows are reported explicitly — an env var that goes
missing looks identical to a tool that simply has no config.

Everything remaining stays a symlink, either because the format has no include
directive and no env-var equivalent (`.gitignore_global`, whose global ignores survive
via the `.gitconfig` stub's `core.excludesfile` override) or because it is only ever
used interactively (Windows Terminal, GlazeWM, Zebar).

Three consequences worth knowing:

- **`~/.gitignore_global` stays a symlink on purpose.** A `.gitignore` has
  nothing to include, so the `.gitconfig` stub instead overrides
  `core.excludesfile` to point straight at the repo copy — *after* the include,
  because last value wins for a single-valued key.
- **`~/.ssh/config` bites twice.** As a symlink it also stalls the ssh **client**
  on the host itself, because `ssh.exe` reads it at startup and inherits the same
  enforcement. Symptom: a plain `ssh` hangs while `ssh -F NUL` returns instantly.
- **nvim's reparse point was on the PARENT.** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim` was a directory
  symlink onto `nvim/`, so the wired path was the directory itself, not a file in it.
  The symptom is unmistakable once seen: over ssh the editor starts bare — **netrw
  and a black background** — because `init.lua` was never read, and this config
  disables netrw and loads tokyonight eagerly. The stub form makes the *directory*
  real and wires `init.lua` inside it.

  **Prepending `runtimepath` is not enough on its own**, and this is the part worth
  reading before touching the shim. lazy.nvim's `performance.rtp.reset` defaults to
  **true**, and `lazy.setup()` therefore *replaces* `runtimepath` wholesale with a
  list rebuilt from `stdpath('config')` — the shim directory. The prepend is gone
  before an eagerly-loaded spec runs. Observed exactly once as: `netrw=1` and the
  config clearly loading, then `Failed to run 'config' for tokyonight.nvim … module
  'gerrrt.utils.ui-highlights' not found`. `performance.rtp.paths` would be the
  supported answer, but it is set in `nvim/`, which is Core-owned.

  So the shim survives the reset itself, two ways:

  - **An appended `package.loaders` searcher** for `<repo>/nvim/lua`. Setting
    `package.path` does nothing here — Neovim replaces the stock path searcher with
    `vim._load_package`, and `vim.loader.enable()` removes that and `table.insert`s
    its cached loaders at 2 and 3, so `package.path` is never consulted. A searcher
    at the *end* is reached on a miss, is only shifted (never displaced) by those
    inserts, costs nothing until a lookup has already failed, and cannot shadow a
    plugin module. This is what covers the window *during* `lazy.setup()`.
  - **Re-prepending `runtimepath` after the config returns**, because a searcher only
    answers `require()`. `colors/`, `ftplugin/`, `syntax/`, treesitter queries,
    `:scriptnames` and `:checkhealth` all go through `runtimepath`.

  Two further knock-on effects. `stdpath('config')` is the shim directory rather than
  the repo, so the shim seeds lazy.nvim's lockfile from `<repo>/nvim/lazy-lock.json`
  itself (Core's `lazy.lua` seeds from `stdpath('config')`, which no longer holds
  one) and `<leader>rc` opens the shim — also unfixable here. And the daily
  `dotfiles-maint` task, Task Scheduler being `0x105` too, had been running
  `nvim --headless +Lazy! sync` with no config at all.

  A parent-side reparse point also breaks the obvious probe: asking whether the
  *wired path* is a link answers "no" while the row is thoroughly broken. So
  `dotfiles-doctor` walks the whole path (`Test-DotPathViaReparsePoint`), and
  `install.ps1` retires such a parent before writing the stub (`Clear-StubParent`) —
  without that, every path operation resolves through the old link and the shim
  lands inside the Core-mirrored `nvim/` tree, dirtying it silently.

Re-wire an existing box with:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -SkipPackages
```

`dotfiles-doctor` reports a stub row as `stub -> repo`, and flags a stub-kind row
that is still a symlink as *"will not resolve over ssh"*.

### The one that needed a schedule: scoop

`scoop` points every app at its current version with a **junction**
(`scoop\apps\<app>\current`), and it creates those junctions as *you* — a non-admin —
so under enforcement every one is untrusted. On a box with 78 scoop apps, all were
unreachable over ssh: no `starship`, no `mise`, no `jj`.

Ownership is a red herring here (see the discriminator note above): `icacls
/setowner` on the link or the target does nothing, because trust is fixed at
**creation** from the creator's token. There is no stub trick for a junction and no
way to relax the policy. The one thing that works is to **re-create each junction
from an elevated process**, so the new junction is stamped admin-trusted. By hand,
for one app (elevated) — clear scoop's ReadOnly bit first, or `rmdir` refuses it,
then drop the link (never the target) and re-make it:

```powershell
$cur = "$env:USERPROFILE\scoop\apps\<app>\current"
$item = Get-Item -LiteralPath $cur -Force
$target = @($item.Target)[0]
$item.Attributes = $item.Attributes -band (-bnot [System.IO.FileAttributes]::ReadOnly)
cmd /c rmdir "$cur"
cmd /c mklink /J "$cur" "$target"
```

**`apps\<app>\current` is not the only junction that matters.** scoop also wires
persisted state back *out* of an app dir with more junctions into
`scoop\persist\<app>\...` — `bat\syntaxes`, `bat\themes`, `btop-lhm\themes`,
`composer\cache`, `composer\home`, `mpv\portable_config`, `php\cli`,
`syncthing\config`, the yt-dlp plugin dirs — and `scoop\modules\gsudoModule` is a
junction into `apps\gsudo\current` from outside `apps\` entirely. On this host that
is 15 further junctions, all created by the same non-admin scoop process and
untrusted for the same reason: re-stamp only `current` and `bat --list-themes` is
still broken over ssh. So the sweep is **every directory reparse point under the
scoop root**, not a tour of the app dirs. (Hardlinks live in those trees too —
`bat\current\config`, `btop-lhm\current\btop.conf` — and are *not* reparse points,
so they are skipped. A recursive walk reports each physical junction exactly once,
under its canonical path, because `-Recurse` does not descend *through* a reparse
point.)

scoop re-creates the junctions (untrusted again) on every upgrade, so this needs
re-applying, not a one-off. `maint/Repair-ScoopJunctions.ps1` is the sweep;
`maint/Maintenance.ps1` runs it right after the scoop upgrade. An app whose files
are in use — `pwsh` running the runner itself — fails its `rmdir` and is left alone
for the next run.

It needs **elevation**, and the daily `dotfiles-maint` task is registered
non-elevated on purpose, so that `scoop update` never runs as admin. That is why
there are two tasks:

| Task | Runs as | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dotfiles-maint` | you, `RunLevel Limited` | the daily update run. Its junction step logs one `SKIPPED … not elevated` line and moves on |
| `dotfiles-maint-scoop-junctions` | **SYSTEM**, an hour later | nothing but the junction sweep |

`maint-install` registers both — but registering an elevated task itself requires an
elevated shell, so run unelevated it installs the daily task and says plainly that it
skipped the other one. SYSTEM rather than you-at-`RunLevel Highest` because an
Interactive task only runs *while someone is logged on*, and the case this fixes is
nobody being; `-ScoopRoot` and `-LogPath` are baked into the action since SYSTEM's
profile paths are not yours. Sequencing is a time offset rather than an event
trigger on the first task completing, because
`Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational` is disabled by default and that
subscription would never fire.

**A scheduled task is only as good as the path baked into it.** Task Scheduler
stores an absolute executable path and never re-resolves it, and a Store-installed
pwsh lives in a *version-pinned* package directory
(`…\WindowsApps\Microsoft.PowerShell_<ver>_…\pwsh.exe`). When Windows cleans up a
superseded package, the task starts failing with `0x80070002` — and it fails
**silently**, because a task that never launches writes nothing to `maint.log`. The
junction sweep then just stops, and the host quietly goes back to being unreachable.

So `maint-install` prefers a version-stable path: the MSI install
(`%ProgramFiles%\PowerShell\7`), then the machine-wide app alias, then the per-user
one. The daily task runs as you and can use the per-user alias; **the SYSTEM task
cannot** — SYSTEM's `%LOCALAPPDATA%` is under `config\systemprofile` and holds no
such alias — so with a Store-only pwsh it stays version-pinned and `maint-install`
warns as much. Installing the MSI build (`winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell`)
gives both tasks a stable path.

Three things now report it rather than letting it rot: `maint-status` shows each
task's `Execute` and flags a missing one, `dotfiles-doctor` carries a **Maint tasks**
row, and both say plainly when the SYSTEM task simply is not visible — Task Scheduler
ACLs a SYSTEM-principal registration to SYSTEM and Administrators, so an unelevated
shell cannot tell a broken one from a healthy one and must not pretend otherwise.

Preview what a sweep would touch, without changing anything:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File maint\Repair-ScoopJunctions.ps1 -DryRun
```

### The things people usually blame, and how to rule them out fast

None of these caused the failure above, but they are real and cheap to check:

```powershell
whoami                      # is the ssh session even the account you think?
$PROFILE; Test-Path $PROFILE
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List   # NB: Process scope does NOT reach an ssh session
Get-Item -LiteralPath $PROFILE -Stream Zone.Identifier -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

- `Test-Path $PROFILE` false → the ssh session resolved a *different* `$PROFILE`
  (different account, or a `Documents` redirect that only exists interactively).
- `CurrentUser` is `Undefined` while `Process` is `Bypass` → your terminal
  shortcut launches pwsh with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, and **a Process-scope
  policy is not inherited by an ssh session**. Fix with
  `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`.
- A `Zone.Identifier` stream exists → Mark-of-the-Web; the repo arrived as a
  download, not a clone. `Get-ChildItem $env:DOTFILES_WIN -Recurse -File | Unblock-File`.

### `ssh host <command>` hangs

Not a trust problem, and easy to mistake for one. Windows OpenSSH's default shell
is `cmd.exe` unless `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH\DefaultShell` says otherwise — and if
`DefaultShell` points at `pwsh.exe` but **`DefaultShellCommandOption` is unset**,
then `ssh host <command>` launches pwsh interactively and waits on stdin forever.
Interactive `ssh host` works; every scripted command hangs.

```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH' -Name DefaultShellCommandOption -Value '-Command' -PropertyType String -Force
```

### The key that isn't read

If your account is in the local **Administrators** group, the stock `sshd_config`
contains:

```text
Match Group administrators
    AuthorizedKeysFile __PROGRAMDATA__/ssh/administrators_authorized_keys
```

so a key appended to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` is read by **nobody**. If that block
is commented out (as it is on a hand-tuned host), `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` is used
and everything works — but restoring a stock config would silently break key auth.
The machine-level file is also ignored unless its ACL grants only Administrators
and SYSTEM.

---

## Keeping sshd up

Redirection Guard is about whether an ssh session can *read your config*. This is the
separate question of whether sshd is *running at all* — and on a real host it turned out
to be the one that actually cost time.

**The failure mode.** Stood up by hand, this box ended up with a bare `sshd.exe` and
nothing supervising it:

```powershell
sc.exe query sshd                                  # 1060: service does not exist
Get-ScheduledTask | ? { $_.Actions.Execute -match 'ssh' }   # nothing
```

No service, no scheduled task. Every crash and every reboot needed a human. Worse, the
absence is easy to misdiagnose: a SYSTEM-principal task is ACL'd away from an unelevated
shell, so "I can't see a task" reads the same as "there is no task." Settle it by reading
the task definitions off disk instead, where a missing file and an unreadable one differ:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem C:\Windows\System32\Tasks -Recurse -File |
    Where-Object { (Get-Content $_.FullName -Raw) -match 'ssh' }
```

**The fix.** A Windows service with recovery actions, which is what `remote-install` sets up:

```powershell
admin            # the service APIs need a token; remote-install refuses without one
remote-install
remote-status    # safe unelevated — reports, changes nothing
```

Two details it exists to get right, both of which look fine until they don't:

- **Registration is not health.** scoop's `install-sshd.ps1` registers the service with the
  default recovery policy, which is *take no action*. Such a service reports `Running` and
  still stays dead the first time it crashes. `remote-install` checks `sc.exe qfailure`
  separately from registration, and sets `restart/5000/restart/10000/restart/30000` with the
  failure count reset daily — so a slow drip of crashes never exhausts the actions.
- **The ImagePath must go through the `current` junction**, not its resolved target. A
  version-pinned path works until the next `scoop update openssh` removes that directory,
  and then every start fails with `0x80070002` — silently, because a service that cannot
  launch writes nothing anywhere you'd look. This is the same trap as
  `Get-DotStablePwshPath` and the scheduled tasks. Traversing the junction is fine: the
  scoop junction task re-stamps it admin-trusted, which is what makes it readable under
  `services.exe`'s `0x105`.

**Hold openssh once the service exists.** A running service holds its binaries open, so the
daily `scoop update *` cannot replace them — it fails, and since the maintenance runner now
reports per-app failures honestly, it fails loudly once a day forever. Holding it also stops
scoop restoring a stock `sshd_config`, which is its own outage (see
[The key that isn't read](#the-key-that-isnt-read)):

```powershell
scoop hold openssh
```

Upgrade it deliberately instead: `Stop-Service sshd`, `scoop unhold openssh`,
`scoop update openssh`, `scoop hold openssh`, `remote-install` (re-points the ImagePath if
the junction moved), `Start-Service sshd`.

---

### The shell that isn't there

A healthy service still refuses **every** login if `HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH\DefaultShell`
names a shell sshd cannot launch. Measured on this host:

```
User garrett not allowed because shell
  c:\program files\windowsapps\microsoft.powershell_7.6.5.0_x64__...\pwsh.exe does not exist
```

PowerShell had moved 7.6.5.0 -> 7.6.6.0 and Windows deleted the superseded package
directory. sshd rejects *before authentication completes*, so the client is told only:

```
Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive).
```

Every symptom points at keys. Nothing points at the shell. Hours went into
`authorized_keys` permissions before the server's own log settled it — so check
`C:\ProgramData\ssh\logs\sshd.log` first, not the keys.

**A DefaultShell target must clear two independent bars**, and the obvious fix for one
trips the other:

| Disqualifier | Example | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Version-pinned** | `...\WindowsApps\Microsoft.PowerShell_7.6.6.0_x64__...\pwsh.exe` | deleted when that version is superseded — works today, locks you out on the next update |
| **Reparse point** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\pwsh.exe` | version-stable, but an AppExecLink; sshd is `0x105` and reports it as "does not exist" (see [section 1](#1-why-the-profile-is-untrusted-over-ssh)) |

`remote-status` grades it — `ok`, `fragile` (works now, version-pinned) or `broken` — and
`remote-install` repoints it at the first machine-wide real file it finds, preferring
`C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe`.

**Getting that MSI is its own trap.** winget's `Microsoft.PowerShell` manifest can be
`Installer Type: msix` only, in which case `winget install` reinstalls the Store build —
`--force` included — and `C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\` never appears. Take the MSI
straight from the release:

```powershell
gsudo msiexec /i https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.6.6/PowerShell-7.6.6-win-x64.msi /qn
```

A Store-only PowerShell arms this class of failure everywhere an absolute pwsh path is
stored — scheduled tasks (`Get-DotStablePwshPath`), the sshd service ImagePath, and
DefaultShell. The MSI retires all three at once.

---

## 2. Why the Linux boxes stopped answering

### It is usually not a port collision

The common advice is that the Windows sshd binds `0.0.0.0:22` at boot and starves
a distro sshd that wants the same port. That is only true if you actually left the
Windows host on 22 — check before assuming:

```powershell
Get-Content C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config | Select-String '^Port'
```

Give one port per box either way. A distro's port is set **inside the distro**, in
`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, which belongs to that distro's own repo
(`dotfiles-Debian` for the Kali/Debian/Ubuntu family) — not to this one:

```bash
# inside the distro
sudo sed -i 's/^#\?Port .*/Port 2222/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl enable --now ssh
```

To see what is actually listening, grab the banners from the host — this
identifies each daemon rather than guessing from config:

```powershell
foreach ($p in 22,2220,2222,2223,2224,2225,2226) {
  $c = New-Object Net.Sockets.TcpClient
  if ($c.ConnectAsync('127.0.0.1',$p).Wait(1200) -and $c.Connected) {
    $c.ReceiveTimeout = 1200
    '{0}  {1}' -f $p, (New-Object IO.StreamReader($c.GetStream())).ReadLine()
  }
  $c.Close()
}
```

The Debian-family banners (`OpenSSH_10.3p1 Debian-4`) distinguish a Kali distro
from an Arch or Fedora one at a glance.

### The distro isn't running

This is the real cause of "it only works when I have a terminal open".

WSL2 tears a distro down once its **last process exits**, and the utility VM
follows after `vmIdleTimeout`. A distro running real **systemd** stays up once
started, because PID 1 never exits — one without it (Alpine, or any distro whose
`/etc/wsl.conf` says `systemd=true` but whose PID 1 is not systemd) does not.

The host-side fix is a **boot task that starts each distro you want reachable**.
A task that runs bare `wsl.exe --exec true` starts only the *default* distro,
which is a common and confusing half-fix:

```powershell
# one action per distro, not one action total
wsl.exe -d <distro> --exec /bin/true
```

Optionally add `vmIdleTimeout=-1` under `[wsl2]` in `%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig` so
the VM stops winding down while you are away. It needs `wsl --shutdown` to apply,
which kills every running distro and any session inside them — so do it
deliberately.

Check what is up, and who is connected to what, without guessing:

```powershell
wsl -l -v                                     # which distros are running
wsl -d <distro> --exec who                    # who is logged in, and from where
```

> With `networkingMode=mirrored`, `ss` inside any distro shows the **host's**
> whole peer list, so it cannot tell you which distro a connection belongs to.
> Use `who` for per-distro attribution.

### Restarting the host sshd does not drop your distro sessions

Worth knowing before you hesitate over a restart. If you reach the distros
directly (MacBook → distro port), those connections are served by each distro's
own sshd *inside* the distro, and the Windows sshd is not in the path. Restarting
it drops only what is connected to the host's own port — and even then, existing
sshd session processes survive, because each session is an independent process
tree. Check first:

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort <hostport> -State Established
```

Sessions reached via `ProxyJump` through the Windows host **are** in the path and
will drop.

## 3. "It used to work while the machine was asleep"

It didn't, and this is worth being blunt about: **a sleeping Windows box serves no
ssh.** What changed is almost certainly that the box now actually sleeps.

- **Don't sleep on AC:** `powercfg /change standby-timeout-ac 0`. Check what you
  already have with
  `powercfg /query SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_SLEEP STANDBYIDLE` — an index of `0` means
  it never sleeps on AC and this is not your problem.
- **Wake-on-LAN**, if you must: enable it on the NIC and in firmware, then send a
  magic packet before connecting. Unreliable on Modern Standby (S0) laptops, and
  **fast startup** must be off or a shut-down box will not wake at all.

## 4. What to expose

The default shape is **one open port** to the Windows host, with the distros
reached through it:

```sshconfig
# on the machine you ssh FROM
Host winbox
    HostName 192.168.1.50
    Port 2220
    User you
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Host kali
    HostName 127.0.0.1        # loopback from winbox's point of view
    Port 2222
    ProxyJump winbox
```

The distro half of that is generated, not hand-written. Run this **on the Windows
host** and paste the output into the client's `~/.ssh/config`:

```powershell
wsl-ssh-config -JumpHost winbox
```

It allocates a stable port per distro from the *sorted* distro list, so the map
does not shuffle when you install, unregister or re-default one — a port that
moves is worse than no port, because it is already baked into ssh_config,
firewall rules and muscle memory. It also refuses to hand out the port the
Windows sshd itself answers on; pass `-HostPort` if that is not 22. Without
`-JumpHost` it emits the direct shape instead, dialling this box's LAN address.

It prints and never writes — the file this belongs in is on the other machine.
The `winbox` entry stays hand-written for the same reason: it carries your key
and account, which this repo does not know.

The alternative — a LAN firewall rule per distro — is one hop less and one more
network-facing listener per distro. Prefer the jump host for anything reachable
from outside the house.

Whatever you expose, `sshd_config` should have `PasswordAuthentication no` once
your key works. Verify the key **first**, in a second session, with the first one
still open.
