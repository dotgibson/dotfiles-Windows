.SYNOPSIS
  Report managed scoop/winget apps whose upstream version is ahead of packages.lock.json.

.DESCRIPTION
  FINDINGS ONLY — this never edits the lock. Re-pinning requires the apps actually
  installed (run Update-PackageLock.ps1 on your box), so this just flags what is behind.
  Built to run on a windows-latest runner via .github/workflows/package-freshness.yml,
  where scoop + winget resolve real versions. Writes a markdown report to -ReportPath
  when anything is behind; removes the file and exits 0 when everything matches.

  Reuses Read-PackageLock / Get-LockedVersion from packages/PackageLock.ps1 so it reads
  the lock exactly as the rest of the package tooling does, and Compare-PackageVersion
  to compare DIRECTIONALLY: a row is a finding only when upstream is newer than the
  lock. Trailing-zero padding ("2.7.10.0" vs "2.7.10") is the same release, a lock that
  runs AHEAD of its source (winget advertising TranslucentTB 2026.1 with 2026.2.0.0
  locked, #234/#250) is noted but not a finding, and a pair that cannot be ordered is
  listed under "Skipped" with both versions rather than guessed either way. Per-app
  failures are warned and skipped — a single unresolvable package never fails the run.

    <#
      Return why a bucket clone can't be trusted, or $null when it's fine.

      This exists because a bucket is a git clone, and a git clone can get STUCK.
      A wedged clone doesn't error — `scoop update` prints its failure and moves on,
      and every manifest this script then reads is served from whatever commit the
      bucket froze at. The versions still parse, still compare, and still come back
      "matching", so the freshness check goes green on stale data. That is the worst
      possible failure mode for a check: wrong in the REASSURING direction.

      Not hypothetical. On 2026-08-04 the `extras` clone was stuck mid-merge on an
      upstream rename (`UD bucket/pycharm.json`) and had been since mid-July. Locally
      `scoop status` reported lazygit and tailscale "latest version" while this bot
      correctly had them months behind — the box contradicted CI, and the box was
      wrong. Reset to origin and it immediately reproduced the bot's findings.

      Cheap enough to run unconditionally: a handful of git calls. On a CI runner the
      buckets are freshly added so this is a no-op, but it also catches the case where
      the `scoop bucket add` loop above swallowed a failure (its catch is empty) and
      left a bucket missing — today that degrades quietly into a "no manifest version"
      skip for every app in it.

        unordered — the two differ but Compare-PackageVersion cannot say which way.
                    Neither hidden nor claimed as behind: the report lists it with both
                    versions and still files, so a shape the comparer does not read
                    surfaces instead of vanishing.
