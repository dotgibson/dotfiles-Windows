#  theme-sync.ps1  -  refresh theme/palette.toml from dotfiles-core
#
#  The THIRD asset this standalone repo mirrors from Core, after nvim/ and
#  starship/starship.toml. Core's theme/palette.toml is the one place a colour is
#  authored in the fleet: dotfiles-core#679 replaced ~90 hand-copied hexes with a
#  single flat table plus scripts/gen-theme.sh, and `make audit` fails on drift.
#  dotfiles-Windows was the last repo still typing the numbers (#228) — and three
#  fzf values had ALREADY drifted (border/scrollbar #27a1b9 vs Core's #29a4bd,
#  gutter #16161e vs #1d202f) under a comment claiming the block was kept
#  byte-for-byte in step. Nothing checked it, so nothing caught it.
#
#  This script vendors the palette; gen-theme.ps1 renders it into the consumers.
#  The split is deliberate and mirrors Core's: syncing is a NETWORK operation that
#  lands one file, generation is an OFFLINE operation over the tree. CI runs the
#  second on every PR and the first on a schedule.
#
#  Usage (from the repo root):
#    .\theme-sync.ps1                                  # shallow-clone the remote, copy the toml
#    .\theme-sync.ps1 -CoreLocal C:\src\dotfiles-core  # copy from an existing clone instead
#    .\theme-sync.ps1 -Branch dev                      # sync from a different Core branch
#    .\theme-sync.ps1 -Ref v5.0.0                      # pin an exact Core commit/tag (reproducible)
#    .\theme-sync.ps1 -Force                           # abandon a recorded pin, track the branch tip
#
#  PINS ARE STICKY, for the same reason starship's are: once a run records
#  `pinned = vX.Y.Z` in theme/.core-ref, a later BARE run honours it rather than
#  silently dragging the file to the branch tip. The scheduled workflow invokes this
#  with no arguments, so without that a deliberate pin would be reverted with nothing
#  in the diff to say so. Use -Force to drop the pin and resume tracking -Branch.
#
#  After it runs: `.\gen-theme.ps1`, review `git diff`, then commit. A palette sync
#  that is not followed by a generate leaves the tree in exactly the state this whole
#  change exists to prevent — which is why gen-theme.ps1 -Check gates every PR.

# scripts/tag-release.sh with `git tag -fa`, AFTER the specific tag. Both are annotated
