# ============================================================================
#  tests/Maint.Tests.ps1  -  the maintenance runner's own docs, and the policy
#  behind the scheduled tasks that carry it.
#
#  Three subjects, one feature:
#
#  1. Maintenance.ps1 states its step list in THREE places — the file header, the
#     -Help block, and the actual Step calls. Nothing kept them honest, so both
#     prose copies silently lost the scoop junction step (and the header lost navi
#     as well). The gate below discovers the steps from the AST and fails when a
#     step is not documented in both.
#
#  2. Get-DotStablePwshPath — which pwsh a task is registered against. Task
#     Scheduler stores an absolute path forever, and a Store pwsh resolves to a
#     version-pinned package dir that vanishes on update, taking the daily run and
#     the junction sweep with it (0x80070002, silently: a task that never launches
#     writes nothing to maint.log).
#
#  3. Get-DotMaintTaskHealth — whether a registered task can still run.
#
#  2 and 3 are pure, so both are tested with hand-built rows: no real task is
#  registered, no admin token is needed, and no particular pwsh install is assumed.
