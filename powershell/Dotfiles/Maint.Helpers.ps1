# ============================================================================
#  Maint.Helpers.ps1  -  pure logic for the maintenance scheduled tasks: which
#  pwsh a task should be registered against, and whether a registered task is
#  still able to run. Owned by the Dotfiles module.
#
#  Both live here rather than in os/40-maint.ps1 for the same reason
#  Get-DotScoopJunctionPlan does: the caller performs every host read (Test-Path,
#  Get-ScheduledTask, Get-ScheduledTaskInfo) and these functions decide what
#  those reads MEAN — so the policy is unit tested without registering a real
#  task, without an admin token, and without a particular pwsh install.

#
# Task Scheduler stores an ABSOLUTE path and never re-resolves it, so that path
# has to still be valid months later. `(Get-Command pwsh).Source` is the wrong
# answer for that: when PowerShell is installed from the Store it resolves to the
# VERSION-PINNED package directory —
#   C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.PowerShell_7.6.5.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\pwsh.exe
# — and the moment Windows cleans up a superseded package that directory is gone
# and every run fails with 0x80070002 (ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND). Silently: a task
# that never launches writes nothing to maint.log, so the daily run just stops.
#
# So the caller probes the stable locations first (MSI install, machine-wide app
# alias, per-user app alias, scoop shim) and passes the Get-Command answer LAST,
# flagged Stable = $false — it is a real answer, just a version-pinned one, and a
# warned-about task beats no task at all.
#
# The asymmetry that makes this more than a list is RunAs. A per-user
# app-execution alias under %LOCALAPPDATA% is version-stable and perfectly good
# for the daily task, which runs as you — but the junction task runs as SYSTEM,
# whose LOCALAPPDATA is C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local and
# holds no such alias. A UserScoped candidate is therefore not merely unstable for
# SYSTEM, it does not exist there, so it has to be rejected outright.
