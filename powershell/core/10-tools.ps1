# provides: Get-InitCache, Clear-InitCache, shell-bench, prof-trace, Invoke-DotfilesSessionizer, Invoke-DotLoadPSFzf
# requires: Get-DotStringSha256, Test-Cmd, Test-InMux, Test-SensitiveHistoryLine, Write-DotErr, Write-DotHost, Write-DotWarn

# --- FAST_START escape hatch --------------------------------------------------
# Skips ALL the heavy prompt/history/completion init in this fragment. The cheap
# fragments (aliases, functions, op, psmux defs) still load, so the shell stays
# usable - you just drop to the stock PowerShell prompt with no starship/zoxide/
# atuin/carapace wiring. `return` here ends only this dot-sourced fragment; the
# loader in profile.ps1 carries on to the next one.
#
# FAST_START is read from the ENVIRONMENT at profile-load time, so it must exist
# *before* pwsh starts - setting it in local.ps1 is too late (local loads last).
#   one lean child shell:   $env:FAST_START='1'; pwsh        # child inherits it
#   always lean on this box: [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('FAST_START','1','User')

# them on every reload wastes time and can stack hooks. Track what's already wired
# in a global so a reload is a no-op for the expensive bits. Using $global: (not
# $script:) means this also holds if the fragment is re-sourced on its own.

# But it has one sharp edge: a multi-line PASTE is only safe in Vi mode when the
# terminal delivers it as a single BRACKETED-PASTE block (ESC[200~ … ESC[201~),
# which PSReadLine inserts literally regardless of edit mode. Without bracketed
# paste the block is replayed keystroke-by-keystroke and Vi interprets `:`/`d`/
# `i`/`a`/`o`/`Esc` as commands — the classic "paste switches modes / reorders
# text / runs vim commands" bug. Bracketed paste needs PSReadLine >= 2.2.0
# (Windows Terminal already sends it), so packages/modules.ps1 pins a recent
# PSReadLine and the version guard below self-diagnoses a stale in-box build.

# binary is newer than the cache (i.e. after a scoop upgrade). The cache file is
# dot-sourced by the CALLER at global scope (this fragment runs global), so prompt
# hooks / key handlers register exactly as they did with Invoke-Expression.
#   Get-InitCache returns the path to a ready-to-source file (or $null on failure,
#   so each call site can fall back). Bust the whole cache with `init-cache-clear`.

    #                     marker comment on the cache file's first line. Editing the
    #                     flags here (e.g. `zoxide init powershell --cmd cd`) changes

# --- mise (runtime/tool version manager; shims + path setup) ------------------
# `mise activate pwsh` installs the per-prompt `mise hook-env` hook that keeps the
# active tool versions / [env] consistent with the nearest .mise.toml / .tool-versions
# as you `cd` around — the Windows equivalent of Core's zsh `mise activate zsh`, and
# the fleet-parity default.
#
# HISTORY: this was briefly switched to `--shims` because the hook cost 0.6-1.2s on
# EVERY prompt — but that turned out to be stacked on-access AV (Malwarebytes + McAfee)
# scanning mise.exe's launch, not mise itself. With the AV exclusions in place,
# `mise hook-env` is ~64ms, so the full hook is back as the default (parity + per-cd env).
#
# Escape hatch for any future slow box (or a machine without the AV fix): set
# DOTFILES_MISE_SHIMS=1 in the User environment BEFORE the shell starts (local.ps1
# loads too late to gate this) to use shims-only mode — a 90-char PATH prepend, no
# prompt hook. Tool versions still resolve via the shims; you just lose mise's per-cd
# env auto-injection (direnv, wired separately, still covers .envrc env).
#
# PSMUX SPLITS ALSO USE SHIMS. Dot-sourcing the full hook-env init is the single most
# expensive step in a pane's cold start — ~195ms of first-run JIT, measured, vs ~12ms
# for the shims init (8.3KB of per-prompt hook code vs a 90-char PATH prepend). A split
# is a fresh pwsh that INHERITS the parent shell's already-resolved env (PATH + the
# [env] mise injected for the starting dir), so shims give correct tool versions with
# no re-activation cost; the only thing traded away is per-cd [env] re-injection WITHIN
# that split (direnv still covers .envrc). Net ~180ms off every split. Pane detection
# is Test-InMux (core/05-lib.ps1). Distinct cache names ('mise' vs 'mise-shims') keep a
# split and a top-level shell from busting each other's cache on the shared mise.ps1.

# bare-prompt host port of zsh's sesh-on-Ctrl+G, mirroring psmux/scripts/psmux-sesh.ps1
# (the in-psmux prefix+f version). This REPLACES navi's old Ctrl+G cheatsheet widget:
# navi now lives in NO shell binding (matching the contract), reachable as the `navi`
# command / the `cheat` helper — which frees Ctrl+G for the sessionizer on both shells.
#
# The key handler types+runs the function as a normal foreground command (RevertLine /
# Insert / AcceptLine), so fzf and the interactive psmux attach behave exactly as they
# would when typed — no nested-readline weirdness. We call `psmux new-session -A`
