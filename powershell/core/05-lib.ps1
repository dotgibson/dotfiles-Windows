#  core/05-lib.ps1  -  pure, side-effect-free helpers shared across the layers.
#
#  Loads right after 00-aliases (so Test-Cmd exists) and before everything that
#  uses these helpers. NOTHING here shells out, registers a hook, or prints on
#  load — which is also what lets the test suite dot-source this one file in
#  isolation and assert on the functions (see tests/Lib.Tests.ps1).

# --- Test-SensitiveHistoryLine ------------------------------------------------
# Decide whether a command line is sensitive enough to keep OUT of the saved
# PSReadLine history file (it stays usable in-session; it just isn't persisted).
# The PSReadLine analog of Core's HISTORY_IGNORE.
#
# The earlier inline regex matched bare substrings, so it quietly dropped the
# everyday `pwd` command (and anything containing "pass"/"creds"/...), meaning
# common navigation never made it into history. This version is word-boundaried
# and context-aware: secret-bearing KEYWORDS only as whole words, secret-carrying
# FLAGS only when dash-prefixed, and the 1Password live-read verbs as phrases.
# `pwd`, `compass`, "first pass", etc. are no longer false positives.
